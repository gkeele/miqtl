Description: This package contains a number of useful QTL mapping utilities. It supports single locus modeling in terms of haplotype descent and SNPs. These methods make use of a genome cache directory that contains information on haplotype descent for all individuals at all loci in a specific file setup. For haplotypes, both regression-on-probabilities (ROP) and multiple imputations are possible. For SNPs, dosages (imputation from haplotypes - in the human GWAS sense) are used. An invertible relationship matrix can be used to include a random effect. Exact and approximate (estimation of variance components only under the null model) anlysis are possible. For haplotype analysis, weights can be included on the error covariance matrix.
