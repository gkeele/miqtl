kqtl
====

This package provides a number of different QTL mapping utilities for multiparent populations, both for haplotype association and SNP association.

## Required genetic data format

The functions in this package generally expect that the haplotype data are stored in a genome cache, the directory format output from the HAPPY HMM (Mott *et al.* 2000).
