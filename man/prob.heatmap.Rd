\title{Plot founder haplotype dosages/probabilities, ordered by phenotype}
\usage{
prob.heatmap(marker, p.value = NULL, genomecache, model = "additive",
  phenotype, phenotype.data, merge.by = "SUBJECT.NAME",
  founder.labels = NULL, founder.cex = 1, include.ramp = TRUE,
  include.marker = TRUE, alternative.phenotype.label = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{marker}{A marker that is contained in the genome cache. In general this should be a marker of interest, such as one
beneath a putative QTL peak.}

\item{p.value}{DEFAULT: NULL. Includes the observed p-value in the plot title.}

\item{genomecache}{The path to the genome cache that contains founder haplotype information.}

\item{model}{DEFAULT: "additive". If "additive", dosages are plotted. If "full", probabilities are plotted.}

\item{phenotype}{The name of the phenotype column in the data set.}

\item{phenotype.data}{A data.frame object that contains the phenotype information. Should also have a column that matches
genomes in the genome cache.}

\item{merge.by}{DEFAULT: "SUBJECT.NAME". Specifies the columns to merge phenotype and haplotype data.}

\item{founder.labels}{DEFAULT: "NULL". If NULL, will default to the labels in the genome cache.}

\item{founder.cex}{DEFAULT: 1. Defines the text size of the founder labels.}

\item{include.ramp}{DEFAULT: TRUE. If TRUE, spectrum ramp for dosages or probabilities is included.}

\item{include.marker}{DEFAULT: TRUE. If TRUE, the marker name is included in the title.}

\item{alternative.phenotype.label}{DEFAULT: NULL. Allows for an alternative label for the phenotype.}

\description{
This function produces a probability heatmap plot, ordered by the phenotype. This gives an idea of what the regression
procedure is actually being handed as inputs.
